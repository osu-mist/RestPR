    //TODO move onto integration once this API has interaction (integration) accross resources (units) that are already tested
    //NOTE: Integration testing dependancies on the current prototype of the API
    //USER resource is independant
    //User permissions depends on users and seasons
    //Season is independant
    //Tournament depends on season due to eventOf foriegn key

    //The main interaction flow of RestPR:
      //Create user, create season, post tournaments
         //Posted tournaments kick off a logic heavy process of hitting the challonge site
            //Adding new players, adding new matches and then processing the elo's of all the players within the season

    //Season authorized User posts new tournament
    //Tournament row entry is created
      //All of these new matches from the tournament need to added
        //With each match addition players have to be looked up if they already exist and matched to
          //If they dont exist they get made

    //TODO add date to tournament record so when rankings get calculated the resultset of matches for the season can get
    //sorted by tournament date and then within each tournament they're ordered by tournament depth
    //Figure out sql order by to sort tournaments by depth
        //MOST IMPORTANT THING is that matches get put in with correct tournament id, depth into tournament (WR1, LR1, GF, GFR)

        //TODO design way to handle match addition job queue
        //This really is a batch addition process done by the tournament resource.
